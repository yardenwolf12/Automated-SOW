## Description

Automated SOW is a Python project that leverages AI capabilities to automate the generation of a scope of work for software development projects. The system uses OpenAI's language model to facilitate various aspects of project scoping, such as defining agent roles, formulating the project idea, identifying project epics, and building a development plan for each project feature.
